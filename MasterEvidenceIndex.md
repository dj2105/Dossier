# Master Evidence Index (Fast Verification Pack build + content + consistency)

## Step 1 — Purpose lock and non-negotiable rules (working notes)

**Add pages:** `FV-1`, `FV-2`, `FV-3`.

1. Every item has an EXH code and a page number in the final PDF.
2. Everything is verifiable in <= 3 minutes from FV pages alone.
3. One idea per page: FV-1 (risk map), FV-2 (navigation), FV-3 (argument spine).

## Step 2 — Standardise exhibit naming (single style)

- Single: `EXH: T-22`, `EXH: GH-02.2`
- Range: `EXH: GH-02.2–02.4`
- Multiple: `EXH: T-22; GH-02.2–02.4`

## Step 3 — Master exhibit list (source of truth table)

Minimum columns enforced: `EXH code`, `Date`, `Type`, `Parties`, `Theme tag(s)`, `What it proves`, `PDF page`.

### FV-2a Quick Index (high-leverage, page-confirmed anchors)

| EXH code | Date | Type | Parties | Theme | PDF page | What it proves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EXH: T-22 | 06/10/2025 | Teams transcript | Agent + support/TL participants | ADR / vulnerability | p.31 | Deadlock/ADR cost rationale appears in case-handling discussion. |
| EXH: T-18 | 02/10/2025 | Teams transcript | Agent + SME/TL support | escalation refusal / access | p.84 | “Store only” guidance and escalation refusal loop are evidenced. |
| EXH: GH-02.2 | n/a | Grievance handling record | Grievance process actors | ADR denial / closure | p.141 | ADR denial and closure-despite-unresolved wording are evidenced. |
| EXH: GH-02.3–02.4 | n/a | Copilot/internal risk note | Internal review actors | regulatory risk | pp.142–143 | Internal note flags potential regulatory-breach risk. |

### Remaining appendix series to ingest for complete FV-2b coverage

> **Status note:** Machine-readable sources in this repository currently expose full `T-*` rows and the anchored `GH-02.2/02.3/02.4` items only.
>
> To add every remaining `GH-*`, `SC-*`, `CE-*`, `CT-*`, `AT-*` row (one row per EXH code), run an OCR/page-lock ingestion pass on the dossier appendix pages, then populate the same schema below in code order.

| EXH code | Date | Type/channel | Parties | Theme tag(s) | PDF page | What it proves (8–12 words) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Consistency protocol (keep FV-1/FV-2/FV-3 aligned)

1. Update master register **before** editing FV pages.
2. Perform page-lock pass on the final combined PDF and fill every `PDF page` cell.
3. FV-1 can only cite EXH codes already present in register.
4. FV-3 key cases can only cite EXH codes present in FV-2a or FV-2b.
5. Run random 5-row verification (<= 3 minutes each) before release.
6. If any EXH code lacks page number, mark pack as draft (not filing-ready).
