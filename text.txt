SYSTEMIC COMPLIANCE FAILURES AND EMPLOYMENT LAW VULNERABILITIES: AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATIVE REPORT
1. Executive Overview and Scope of Inquiry
This report presents a forensic analysis of the grievance formally lodged by Mr. Daniel Jackson against Infosys BPM (operating on behalf of BT/EE), focusing on the intersection of regulatory non-compliance, workplace dignity, and procedural fairness. The inquiry is necessitated by the escalation of an internal "Dignity at Work" grievance into a complex legal scenario involving alleged penalisation for whistleblowing, potential constructive dismissal risks, and systemic breaches of the United Kingdom’s telecommunications regulatory framework as enforced by Ofcom.
The core of this analysis is derived from a comprehensive review of the "Dignity at Work – Condensed Complaint Dossier" submitted on November 13, 2025, alongside contemporaneous email correspondence, transcriptions of supervisory interactions (specifically the WebEx meeting with Interim Manager Colm Ryan on November 27, 2025), and the Employee Relations (ER) communication trail. These primary sources are scrutinized against the statutory backdrops of the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 (as amended 2022) in Ireland, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, and the Communications Act 2003 (UK), specifically Ofcom General Conditions C4 and C5.
The prevailing conclusion of this report is that the organization faces a critical convergence of liabilities. The evidence suggests that the handling of the complainant’s grievance has transitioned from procedural inefficiency to active penalisation. Furthermore, the substantive allegations contained within the grievance regarding the mistreatment of vulnerable customers (specifically the "Flagship Case" of the 85-year-old widow) expose the client (BT/EE) to significant regulatory enforcement risks, mirroring historical infractions that have resulted in multi-million pound fines.
1.1 The Dual-Jurisdiction Complexity
It is imperative to contextualize the legal environment. The complainant is employed in Ireland (evidenced by references to "Employee Relations Ireland" and Irish statutory instruments like the WRC). However, the operational duties involve servicing UK consumers under the regulatory purview of Ofcom. This creates a dual-liability structure:
 * Employment Liability (Ireland): Adjudicated by the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) under Irish employment statutes.
 * Regulatory Liability (UK): Adjudicated by Ofcom under the General Conditions of Entitlement.
The analysis below demonstrates how failures in the latter (regulatory compliance) have catalyzed breaches in the former (employment rights), creating a classic "whistleblower penalisation" trajectory.
2. Forensic Chronology of Procedural Breakdown
To understand the "likely conclusions" of a WRC adjudication or internal investigation, one must first establish the timeline of procedural failure. The correspondence reveals a systematic dismantling of the employee’s trust and the imposition of "unworkable" conditions.
2.1 Phase I: The Grievance and the "Interim" Vacuum (Nov 13 – Nov 21)
The employee submitted a detailed grievance dossier on November 13, 2025, alleging bullying, refusal of support, and regulatory breaches. Standard HR practice and the WRC Code of Practice on Grievance and Disciplinary Procedures mandate a prompt initial meeting.
 * The Delay: Instead of an immediate investigation meeting, the employee was placed on paid leave for 13 days (Nov 6–23). While termed a "goodwill gesture" by ER , this delay arguably served to isolate the complainant without resolving the core safety concerns.
 * The Handbook Refusal: On November 18 (Tuesday), the employee requested the Employee Handbook and Disciplinary Policy. As of November 27, despite repeated requests, these documents had not been provided. In Irish employment law, the refusal to provide governing policies during a dispute is often viewed as a denial of fair procedures, severely weakening the employer's defense in any subsequent disciplinary or dismissal hearing.
2.2 Phase II: The "Unworkable" Interim Arrangement (Nov 24 – Present)
Upon return to work, the employee was assigned an "interim manager," Colm Ryan, to avoid contact with the subjects of his grievance (Noel Curran, Shannon Williamson). The transcripts and emails reveal this arrangement was structurally flawed from inception.
 * The Roster Mismatch: The employee identified immediately that his shifts (ending at 21:00) did not align with Colm’s (ending at 17:30 or 18:00).
 * The Safety Gap: This misalignment left the employee unsupervised and unsupported for 3–4 hours daily. Given the nature of the grievance—which cited a lack of support as a cause of stress—this failure to provide coverage was not merely an administrative oversight but a continuation of the conditions that caused the initial injury (stress).
 * The "Meeting Code" Incident (Nov 24): On Monday evening, finding himself without support and having received no reply from ER regarding safe contacts, the employee utilized "meeting code" status to cease taking calls.
 * The Accusatory Response (Nov 27): Rather than rectifying the support gap, the interim manager engaged in a "documented conversation" accusing the employee of call avoidance ("You were not on calls... Why are you not on poles?"). This interaction is critical evidence of penalisation: the employee was placed in an impossible position (work unsafely or stop working) and then disciplined for choosing safety.
2.3 Phase III: Communications Blackout (Nov 24 – Nov 28)
The employee sent urgent emails to Employee Relations on Monday morning (09:00), Monday evening (18:00), and Thursday (15:30) seeking clarification on who he could safely contact.
 * Silence as Hostility: The total failure of ER to respond to these queries for four days, while the employee was actively struggling on shift, constitutes a breakdown of the "duty of care." In A Care Worker v A Care Provider (ADJ-00011215), the WRC found that delays and lack of engagement during an investigation can amount to a repudiation of the contract. The silence effectively communicated to the employee that his safety concerns were immaterial to the organization.
3. Regulatory Compliance Analysis: The Substantive Grievance
The "documented cases" referred to in the user's query relate to the specific customer interactions detailed in the employee's dossier. These cases are not merely customer service failures; they represent potential breaches of the Communications Act 2003 and Ofcom’s General Conditions (GC).
3.1 General Condition C5: Vulnerable Consumers
Ofcom’s GC C5 imposes a strict liability on providers to identify and support vulnerable consumers (defined by age, disability, or circumstance, such as bereavement).
3.1.1 Flagship Case P6-13: The 85-Year-Old Widow
The dossier describes an incident involving an 85-year-old widow who was upsold an expensive package she did not understand.
 * The Violation: The Team Leader (Noel) allegedly instructed the agent that "only the store... can resolve the issue" and that the customer must return there, despite her refusal due to rude treatment.
 * Regulatory Analysis:
   * Barrier to Redress: Forcing a vulnerable, elderly customer to physically return to a location where she felt unsafe or mistreated constitutes a failure to treat the customer with "fairness and empathy," a core requirement of the Treating Vulnerable Consumers Fairly guide.
   * Failure to Record/Act: If the customer’s vulnerability (bereavement) was flagged but ignored to enforce a rigid "store-only" policy, this violates GC C5.2, which requires policies to ensure vulnerable consumers are appropriately supported.
 * Likely Conclusion: If reported to Ofcom, this incident would likely be viewed as an aggravating factor in any enforcement action. Ofcom has previously fined EE £1 million for failures in complaint handling that disadvantaged vulnerable users. The internal instruction to close the complaint without resolution is a direct contravention of the regulator's mandate.
3.2 General Condition C4: Complaints Handling and ADR
General Condition C4 mandates that providers must have a transparent, effective, and accessible complaints handling code of practice. Crucially, it requires access to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) if a complaint remains unresolved after eight weeks (soon to be six) or reaches "deadlock".
3.2.1 The Denial of ADR
The chat logs reveal a Team Leader stating: "we cant offer an ADR to her" because the issue originated in-store.
 * Legal Inaccuracy: This statement is factually incorrect under regulatory law. A "complaint" is any expression of dissatisfaction. The channel of origin (store vs. phone) does not negate the consumer's statutory right to ADR.
 * Deadlock Letter: When the customer refused to return to the store, the complaint reached "deadlock." Under GC C4.3, the provider is obligated to issue a deadlock letter referring the customer to the Ombudsman or CISAS. Refusing to do so is a "slam dunk" regulatory breach.
 * Systemic Pressure: The dossier alleges a pattern where "all complaints must be closed on the call". This directive, if proven to be a management instruction, incentivizes the premature closure of complaints to manipulate statistics (FCR rates). Ofcom explicitly targets such metric-driven malpractice. In 2024, BT was fined £2.8m for failures related to contract transparency, signaling a crackdown on process failures that harm consumers.
3.3 The "Moron" Comment and Dignity at Work
The dossier claims a private Teams message referring to the employee as "that moron Daniel Mark..." was visible on a shared screen.
 * Context: This occurred in the context of the employee raising compliance concerns.
 * Legal Implication: Under the Code of Practice for Employers and Employees on the Prevention and Resolution of Bullying at Work (S.I. 674/2020), bullying is defined as repeated inappropriate behaviour. While a single remark might not constitute bullying in isolation, when combined with the "thumbs up" dismissals, the exclusion from support, and the public shaming in "Joke lads" posts , it forms a cumulative pattern of undermining behaviour. The WRC would likely view this as creating a hostile working environment.
4. Employment Law Analysis: The "Likely Conclusions"
Based on the evidence and the trajectory of the employer's response, the following legal conclusions are highly probable in the event of adjudication by the WRC or the Labour Court.
4.1 Penalisation under the Protected Disclosures Act 2014
The employee's report regarding the mistreatment of the 85-year-old widow and the systemic refusal to offer ADR constitutes a protected disclosure.
 * Relevant Wrongdoing: The report discloses a "failure to comply with a legal obligation" (Ofcom General Conditions) and "endangerment of health and safety" (work-related stress).
 * Penalisation Defined: The 2022 Amendment expanded "penalisation" to include negative performance assessments, harm to reputation, and psychiatric referrals. The "documented conversation" regarding call avoidance (initiated because the employee followed safety instructions) is a textbook form of penalisation. The employer is manufacturing a disciplinary record against a whistleblower.
 * Burden of Proof: Crucially, the burden of proof is reversed. It is presumed the penalisation occurred because of the disclosure. The employer must prove that the "documented conversation" and the refusal to provide support were wholly unrelated to the grievance. Given the chronology, this defense is likely to fail.
 * Likely Outcome: The WRC can award compensation of up to 5 years' remuneration for penalisation under the Act. The "interim measures" that isolate the employee would be viewed as a form of detriment.
4.2 Constructive Dismissal and the "Unworkable" Environment
The employee is currently navigating the internal grievance process, which is a prerequisite for a constructive dismissal claim. However, the "unworkable" nature of the interim arrangement is pushing the employee toward resignation.
 * The "Reasonableness" Test: To claim constructive dismissal, the employee must show that the employer's conduct was so unreasonable that resignation was the only option. The employer's failure to answer emails for four days, refusal to provide the handbook, and conflicting instructions (don't contact Noel, but you must find support when Colm is off) creates an impossible working environment.
 * Breach of Contract: The implied term of "mutual trust and confidence" has been shattered. The "documented conversation" where the employee was threatened with loss of pay ("if I did not simply 'get on with it'... my pay would be withheld" ) for raising safety concerns is likely a repudiatory breach.
 * Likely Outcome: If the employee resigns, they have a strong case for constructive dismissal. The WRC would likely scrutinize the "interim measures" as a sham designed to frustrate the employee.
4.3 Section 27: Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005
The employee explicitly removed himself from the queue on safety grounds ("I went into meeting code... because I had no safe support available").
 * Protection: Section 27 protects employees from penalisation for refusing to work in dangerous conditions. While often applied to physical danger, the WRC has increasingly recognized severe psychological stress and lack of supervision in high-risk roles (like handling angry/vulnerable customers) as valid safety grounds.
 * The "Refusal to Work": The employee's refusal was specific, limited (only when unsupported), and communicated in advance. The employer's attempt to frame this as "call avoidance" rather than a safety issue is a critical error that exposes them to liability under the 2005 Act.
5. Comparative Analysis of "Flagship" Evidence
The "Flagship Cases" identified in the dossier serve as the evidentiary anchor for both the internal grievance and any future litigation.
| Case ID | Core Allegation | Regulatory Breach (Ofcom) | Employment Breach (WRC) |
|---|---|---|---|
| P6-13 | 85-yr-old widow mis-sold; ADR denied; "Moron" comment. | GC C5 (Vulnerable Consumers); GC C4 (ADR denial). | Bullying (Dignity at Work); Penalisation (Hostile environment). |
| P4-1 | 55-minute delay in escalation; Customer waiting. | GC C4 (Timely resolution). | Negligence (Failure to provide tools/support). |
| P6-2 | Employee went AWOL due to stress; "This is a joke lads". | N/A | Duty of Care (Ignoring medical stress signals); Public Shaming. |
| P2-1B | Removal of all offline time/training. | GC C5 (Training requirements). | Constructive Dismissal (Change in working conditions). |
Implications of Data Points:
 * The "Thumbs Up" Dismissal (P2-9): The dossier notes a "Thumbs up" emoji response to a serious query about a rejected credit. This seemingly minor interaction serves as evidence of the dismissive culture that permeates the team, corroborating the claim of isolation.
 * The "Moron" Comment: If the employee can compel the production of this chat log via a Data Subject Access Request (GDPR Article 15), it will be the "smoking gun" for the Dignity at Work claim. The employer's likely defense (that it was "banter" or not meant for the employee) is generally rejected by the WRC in bullying cases where the effect on the victim is the primary measure.
6. Strategic Conclusions and Recommendations
6.1 Likely Conclusions of the Internal Process
Based on the "documented conversation" with Colm Ryan and the silence from Employee Relations, the employer appears to be building a case for disciplinary action against the employee for "call avoidance" or "insubordination." They are framing the employee's adherence to safety boundaries as a refusal to work.
 * Likely Employer Finding: The internal investigation will likely minimize the "moron" comment as an isolated incident and uphold the "call avoidance" charge, possibly leading to a written warning or dismissal.
 * Flaw in Employer Strategy: This approach ignores the Protected Disclosure context. By disciplining a whistleblower for operational disruptions caused by their own failure to provide safe support, the employer is practically guaranteeing a loss in the WRC.
6.2 Likely Conclusions of External Adjudication (WRC/Ofcom)
 * WRC: A finding of Penalisation is highly probable. The failure to align the interim manager's schedule, followed by the refusal to answer emails, followed by disciplinary threats, forms a clear chain of causation linked to the grievance. Compensation would likely reflect the severity of the stress and the high-handedness of the employer.
 * Ofcom: If the "Flagship Case P6-13" is reported, Ofcom would likely view the "store only" instruction as a systemic policy failure regarding vulnerable consumers. While they might not intervene in an individual employment dispute, the evidence from this dispute (chat logs proving managers instruct agents to deny ADR) could trigger a broader compliance audit or fine against the parent company (BT/EE).
6.3 Recommendations for the Complainant
 * Formalize the "Unworkable" Status: Send a final written notice to ER stating that the current arrangement (Colm's schedule mismatch) renders the role unsafe and requesting a specific, named point of contact for the hours of 17:30–21:00.
 * GDPR Request: Immediately submit a Data Subject Access Request (DSAR) for all Teams chats containing the employee's name (specifically seeking the "moron" comment) and the "documented conversation" notes referenced by Colm.
 * Preserve the Status Quo: Continue to log in, report to Colm when available, and strictly follow the "safety first" protocol (going into meeting code if unsupported), documenting every instance via email to ER immediately. This defeats the "call avoidance" narrative by demonstrating willingness to work conditionally on safety.
6.4 Recommendations for the Employer (to mitigate liability)
 * Immediate Alignment: Align the employee's roster with the interim manager or appoint a dedicated cover manager for the evening hours.
 * Release Documents: Immediately provide the Handbook and Grievance Policy. The continued withholding of these is legally indefensible.
 * Suspend Disciplinary Action: Halt any "documented conversations" or disciplinary tracks regarding call avoidance until the Dignity at Work investigation is complete. Proceeding now would be viewed as retaliatory.
In conclusion, the documented cases reveal a systemic collapse in both regulatory compliance and employee duty of care. The "likely conclusion" is that the employer is currently drifting toward a constructive dismissal scenario that carries significant financial and reputational risk due to the protected nature of the disclosures made.

Table 3: Timeline of Communication Failure
| Date/Time | Action Taken by Employee | Employer Response | Legal Implication |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nov 18 (Tue) | Request for Employee Handbook sent to HR. | None (72hr SLA breached). | Procedural Unfairness. |
| Nov 24 (Mon) 08:13 | Email to ER requesting Handbook & Roster Clarification. | None. | Negligence / Communication Breakdown. |
| Nov 24 (Mon) 18:00 | Email to ER stating "unsafe to continue," entering meeting code. | None. | Failure to Act on Safety Concern. |
| Nov 27 (Thu) 14:05 | Colm Ryan messages via Teams accusing of call avoidance. | Hostile. | Penalisation / Disciplinary Threat. |
| Nov 27 (Thu) 15:30 | Email to ER following up on lack of response & safety guidance. | None (as of documentation). | Continuing Breach of Duty of Care. |
This structured analysis highlights that the "likely conclusions" are not merely speculative but are grounded in a demonstrable pattern of evidence that satisfies the burden of proof for multiple statutory breaches. The employer's failure to engage with the substance of the grievance, preferring instead to manage the process through silence and pressure, is the defining characteristic of this case.
