Dear Keith and Deirdre,

Cc: David

I wanted to update you on my situation this afternoon.

I have continued to take calls today and have repeatedly sought guidance in writing on how to handle complex or high-risk cases under the current interim arrangements. I have not yet received any response or clarification on who I can safely use as a point of support.

I am now finding the situation so stressful that I do not feel it is safe or responsible for me to continue taking live calls without a functioning reporting line. I am very concerned about the risk of either misadvising customers or being held personally liable for decisions I have explicitly said I am not supported to make.

For that reason, I am coming out of the queue and going into meeting status for the remainder of my shift unless and until a safe support structure is put in place. I understand this may mean I am not paid for this time, but I believe it would be more serious for both customers and the Company if I continued working in circumstances I have repeatedly stated are unsafe and unworkable.

I remain willing to cooperate fully with the Dignity at Work process and to attend any meetings needed to resolve these issues.

Kind regards,
Daniel
