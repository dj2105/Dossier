 * SME 2 (22/08 14:29): [Quoted] DanielMark Jackson (XBC26 C) 22/08/2025 14:28[Quoted] I didthe comms you shared said "the legal bit" at the very end.
 * SME 2 (22/08 14:30): also when you click on an order, click "view comms" from the order and scroll down to the date and you will see all comms, its a glitch on the system Everyone
 * Daniel Jackson (22/08 14:32): that doesn't prove he agreedyes if we contact a cx with contract info and they dont call in to object it is a binding agreement!ECR (escalations) will always go by if the cx recived comms or not.
 * SME 2 (22/08 14:34): [Quoted] DanielMark Jackson (XBC26 C) 22/08/2025 14:32[Quoted] My understanding is that EE would need to provide evidence of consentwhere did you get that from? thats known as a burden of proof but we have proof and the proof is we sent email etc notifying them there is a contract is place, a 14 day cooling off period a starts and then contract is set.OfCom wont agree with the cx and an Ombudsman would explain the cx is responsible to read and agree/object to all correspondence from service providers.

Under Condition C1.6, a customer's contract can only become effective "once the Relevant Customer has given their Express Consent to enter into the contract after receiving the Contract Summary".
 * Shea Hanton (XBC23 C) (22/08 14:46): [Quoted] DanielMark Jackson (XBC26 C) 22/08/2025 14:43[Quoted] [image]customer would have given consent to tick the box to go forward with the package and the customer did so cause they cant override this system. I understand where your coming from but customer clearly got a contract sent and has responsbility on his side to review said contract to make its correct plus verbal agreement would have been on the call
 * Brian Walsh (XBC26 C) (22/08 14:50): [Quoted] DanielMark Jackson (XBC26 C) 22/08/2025 14:43[Quoted] [image][image: ABOUT YOUR ORDER]it states thanks for renewing your contract at the top and then gives information below, "what youll pay" is broken down and "the legal bit" at the very bottom.Its ok we can all miss things from time to time and believing we are doing whats best for the cx is a great attribute to have however we must stand firm on our T's and C's and be due diligant in our investigating of accounts ensuring the correct information is being given and no assumptions are made as we can be held by them.I hope this helps and if you have anything further you would like to know or learn about Albert is a great tool or just ask here

 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (12/09 17:43): HTTC was applied because he never placed the home move and who ever went into the property took over the line which closed his account
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (12/09 18:17): [Quoted] Noel Curran (XBC26 C) 12/09/2025 17:43[Quoted] HTTC was applied because he never placed the home move and who ever went into the property took over the line which closed h...in which case, not being able to find the call where the home move order wasn't placed could prove an issue. if cx claims they did place the order then the fact people took over his line when they moved in would be bt's responsibility. But, I think what cx is arguing is that he never requested it to be moved, planning then to pay bills instead of getting lump sum httc. if that's the case, then would it be bt's responsibility to have explained the risk of a takeover happening, or the fact it happened would be considered cx's responsibility?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (12/09 18:25): if a request to take over an account comes in, the customer would need to call up to place cancellation, he was aware that someone was after moving into the property and had already requested a takeover before, so he knew it could happen again. the notes indicate the all that happened on the 17th was the cancelled the first takeover request. if he disputes it you can raise a DSAR request to grab the call but there was never a home move order placed and from the fact that he wanted to pay off the current service at the property he didnt want a home move either as a home move would have put him into a new contract
 * Daniel Jackson (12/09 18:38): my report back to cx should be that the httc stand as they are, and if he would like to dispute that, he will have to do so after receiving results of a dsar request, ok?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (12/09 18:39): ya i would only be raising a dsar if he requests one though,

 * Daniel Jackson (11/09 15:32): Hi Noel,This is a difficult message to send as I'm new to the team and don't want to start by raising problems, but I do need to be honest.Thanks for replying, though I was a little confused by your message. What had left me frustrated was not hearing back when I first asked last week, and knowing I wouldn't get a response for another week because of our shifts. I want to be clear - I never mentioned this to other staff or framed it as an issue caused by you. In the original request and notes I explained that, due to the customer's past dissatisfaction, I'd committed to keep the complaint open until they confirmed the credit had landed.I saw you raised the comp and gave it a thumbs up, but refused auto-comp requests now follow a new procedure, and it was that "what happens next?" point I was trying to clarify. When I shared our conversation in the credit chat, it was only to provide context - never to undermine you.Unfortunately this is just one of a number of dead ends I'm facing, and it's causing me a lot of stress which is affecting my logins and offline time. I've raised these difficulties with Shannon Williamson and Jessica O'Driscoll but haven't had any real support. This isn't a criticism of you - I've only had about 1.5 days working with you since joining your team, and without support in your absence I've been left stuck.I do have a one-to-one with you tomorrow, and if you'd prefer to cover this then I'm happy to wait. I just wanted to explain where I'm coming from today. I'm confident I can get past this and learn from it, and I really would like a good working relationship with you and colleagues. I hope neither this message nor my difficulties stand in the way of that.

I calculate it should be for 369.74, but I don't think there's any way to confirm this? And it seems unlikely this will arrive before Sunday. cx has been very clear throughout that she is not giving permission for complaint to close until they have the money. You're saying I should close it on sunday whatever the situation?

He's sending me that letter later today. On the order it does say working line takeover, but order wasn't completed that way. Connections say this is down to openreach. CX had to go, I said I would call back with info when I receive the o2 bill. What should I say happens next?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (04/09 15:54): the customer needs to go back to O2 and cancel the account, and once they have the final bill come back to us then

 * Daniel Jackson (05/09 15:06): While I've got you here, I really need to make clear to someone that I'm struggling without noel here - and our temp ll having been withdrawn today. since being on noel's team i've have almost no opportunity to talk to him, partly because I was on al for a week. I've got a backlog of issues and have overdue actions I'm being chased about.
 * Jessica ODriscoll (XBC26 C) (05/09 15:07): ok and are the actions for callbacks that youre waiting on a call listen update?
 * Daniel Jackson (05/09 15:09): some of them
 * Jessica ODriscoll (XBC26 C) (05/09 15:11): unfortunately the SMEs covering were put back onto calls, as absence is so bad. you can always ask for guidance in the support chat and the rest of us will support wherever we can, but i will make Noel aware that there are some issues

 * Daniel Jackson (06/09 10:40): I was, yes
 * Shannon Williamson (XBC26 C) (06/09 10:40): what time did you log in and what was the reason you were late?
 * Daniel Jackson (06/09 11:00): Excuse me if I'm a bit prickly about this. I also know I could have avoided this situation by logging in on time. But the truth is I'm struggling at the moment. I was moved to Noel's team on 18 August, and I've only had 1.5 days when he's been in (although I was on holiday 1 week) and no support other than the group chat at all other times. I've got a backlog of things I need advice about, some of which I've raised in the group chat and not received feedback about, or only received very vague guidance which puts me in a difficult position with customers. I've got call listens which haven't been done from mid august, and the whole thing is very stressful. I'm well aware it's not how infosys wish me to handle the situation, but after punching in at 9am, I delayed logging in as I looked though some outstanding issues in the hope of getting them resolved. Not that it really helped. I reached out to Jessica O'Drisscoll about this yesterday, and all she said was that I can use the group chat and she'll tell Noel about it (which is of little benefit in my attempts of help customers now)

 * SME 1 (08/09 14:41 Edited): and is it because he hasn't got the deposit back that he's complaining or?
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 14:42): yes. he says it was requested on the basis they needed it to provide service, but wasn't told it could be kept for so long. last they were told jan 2026
 * SME 1 (08/09 14:44): A deposit is kept because of a bad credit score etc. thats why some accounts require a deposit when getting set up and that deposit refund date is depending on if you stay up to date with your bills -reviewing the account and CX has had numerous late payment charges and failed DD etc that we have issued multiple credits forthat would push back on the deposit so unfortunately thats why its taking so long to be issued back
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 14:46 Edited): I understand that and have explained. their point is they were advised it would be returned much sooner and at no point was it explained that it could be kept so long. they are listed vulnerablethey're also very unhappy with bt in general, equipment which has been charged and not received, and callbacks promised byt never received

Bad credit just pay more
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 14:55): co-pilot says: Thanks for the context—your messages in blue show you’re actively handling the customer's concerns. Based on what's been shared, here's a quick breakdown to help you decide whether a team leader (TL) should step in: 🤝 When TL Involvement Might Be Needed * "Escalation Request": If the customer explicitly asks to speak to a manager or TL. * "Unresolved Frustration": The customer is clearly unhappy with BT, feels misled about the deposit refund timeline, and has experienced delays due to credit checks. If they're losing trust or becoming irate, a TL might help de-escalate. * "Policy Exception or Compensation": If the customer is requesting something outside standard process—like early refund or compensation—a TL may need to approve or explain the decision. * "Repeated Issues": If this isn't the first time the customer has contacted BT about this and feels ignored or bounced around, TL involvement can show accountability. ✅ When You Might Handle It Yourself * If the customer is still engaging calmly and you're able to explain the situation clearly. * If you've already offered next steps (e.g., submitting the auto compensation form) and they're receptive. * If you're confident the issue can be resolved without needing higher authority. You're doing a solid job navigating a tricky situation. If you feel the customer's trust is slipping or they're asking for something you can't authorize, escalating to TL is the right move.

 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 16:09): Eamonn, I've just come back from my break and about to call the customer back. Really I don't think that I have anything to add to when I last spoke to them, and certainly I don't have anything to present which gives an answer to either of their primary moans i.e. evidence of information communicated about deposit and (which we didn't discuss earlier) the failed promises given by agents that they will be called back, and coupled with that the fact the complaint was closed without permission given by customer , and no evidence that attemts were made to contact them. I'm going to feel a little silly calling back regarding the request to speak to a manager, if I am then unable to progress the case forward and am then left with the same request to speak to a manager. What do you think?
 * Eamonn OShea (XBC26 C) (08/09 16:26): Did you raise a DSAR?
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 16:27): I haven't no. I will do that now.
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 16:34 Edited): ok, done
 * Eamonn OShea (XBC26 C) (08/09 16:38): Did you also raise a Group Billing?
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 16:40): no. how would you suggest I present it on group billing form, that I'm advocating for a refund?
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 16:49): I don't feel I have the authority for me to make the request. As you said, there's little chance it will be accepted. And as a delaying tactic, having spoken to the complainers, I think it will only aggravate matters
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 17:22): I called the customer as promised and reiterated the current deposit policy and refund timeline. During the call, I acknowledged the lack of documented communication and the customer's concerns around misinformed expectations. As discussed, I've raised a DSAR request on the customer's behalf to allow them access to any relevant call recordings or data from the past 12 months. While the account holder, Rick, has learning difficulties, I've been speaking with Fiona, a registered third party on the account, following explicit verbal consent from Rick during the initial call. Fiona has been the primary point of contact throughout the complaint and is acting on Rick's behalf. Although I understand that any formal resolution may require direct contact with the account holder, I recommend proceeding with Fiona for now to ensure clarity and accessibility. The customer appreciated the transparency and is awaiting further contact from a manager, as previously requested. Please let me know if you're able to take the callback forward or if further action is needed on my side.
 * Eamonn OShea (XBC26 C) (08/09 17:27): What is the account number?
 * Daniel Jackson (08/09 17:28): [redacted]I reopened the complaint. what shall i do with it?
 * Eamonn OShea (XBC26 C) (08/09 19:40): I'll follow up...

 * Daniel Jackson (12/09 19:46): [redacted] I've been speaking to an elderly lady who described herself as bedbound. I think it's fair to say she probably has dementia. There is currently a home move order on her account, which will cease her broadband and landline. She has no knowledge of the transfer, and has been very argumentative. From speaking to her, I think it's clear that if the landline cancels on 3rd oct, as scheduled, this will cause her problems. However, she has now hung up the phone, saying that I was talking rubbish, and saying there must be some sort of phantom at bt. I feel if there is a duty of care to customers, bt should take action to make sure she doesn't lose her landline.

I have a 96 year old lady who has been with bt for over 50 years, landline only, and has just received a bill for 258.15, much to her dismay. Her family have recently got rid of their landline, and they had told her that calling their mobiles wouldn't cost her any more than she'd been paying. I will of course get her moved to unlimited call plan, but can we make any bill shock type refunds on this occasion? She say's she's unable to pay such a high bill and is quite distressed about it.

I have a callback today, around now.[image: redacted box]He seems to be off today. The customer is very very angry. Well he was, and I see notes that he was when he phoned in yesterday too.
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 15:12): just checkingthe account 2 seconds
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 15:13): I should call him by 4. Shall I call and say results have been delayed?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 15:15): was it the call in Aug 24 that you were looking to be listened to
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 15:16): yes. Jason said he'd try and track it down, even though it's over a year
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 15:20): ya the call is to far back to be listened to, so we wont be able to get it, the TV was put onto the account in August last year but he only got charged for it in Sept this yearthats were the increase is coming from
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 15:22): Yes. Is there a reason why it didn't charge until Sept this year? The customer is furious. Saying there's no way he's accepting the increase. says he was promised the tv at £6/month
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 15:27): So in Aug 24 he took out regular sports package which was contracted at 16 pounds[image: redacted box]then in Sept 24 he changed to Big sports, the order shows 45 pounds[image: redacted box]I'm guessing it would have been sent here but the email never sent so that would need to be resent. i would guess that it was just a error on the billing on the account that got fixed in Sept this year
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 15:34): so what's the next step? I think if I call and say he's obliged to pay 106.99, he'll probably explode
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 15:39): only Step we can take is to raise a DSAR if he requests one, I would resend the email to him once you have him on the linewe wouldnt have the call in Sept 24 either
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 15:41): if I call him now, will you be available if he wants to escalate?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 15:42): I can be
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 15:43): and would you suggest I cancel the dd and pause credit schedule for a month to allow time for results?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 15:43): he has to cancel the DD himself, we shouldn't be cancelling itbut that would have to be his choice if he chooses to cancel the DD
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 15:46): so tell him the situation and only take action he requests. Don't give him any guidance?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 15:47): only guidance we can is to send him out the contract and im sure he will make his own decision from there I'm sure
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 15:58 Edited): so the way I see it, I'm heading towards a phone call which I know is going to be very unpleasant. The customer was furious on the call on monday, saying we're thieves and calling him a liar. Saying that the only option now is to wait a month for dsar results could at least be softened by explaining that we can suspend any further payments until dsar results are in. Sending him the contract isn't acknowledging there's been an error on the account which he may not be liable for.
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 16:07): I see that but, the TV has been active since last year, the only way we have now of confirming if the contract is correct or not is with the DSAR as we no longer have the calls, He hasnt been getting charged for tv in at least the last 11/12 months when realistically we should have been. I understand where he is coming from about the increase itself but he would have had the 14 days Cooling off to dispute anything about the contract itself. But you are the one whos going to be handling the call so go forward as you see fit.
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 16:35): [Quoted] Noel Curran (XBC26 C) 09/10/2025 16:07[Quoted] I see that but, the TV has been active since last year, the only way we have now of confirming if the contract is correct or not is with...when I raise a dsar I have to read "Call recordings are kept for 1 year and then are automatically deleted in accordance with our policy." and get confirmation this has been understood. Given that the calls are over a year old, I don't think he'll take that very well. What do you suggest? (it's not my aim to be difficult Noel, promise!)
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 16:42): if that's the case all you can do call him back and tell him the information that we have and realistically escalate it when he asks, thats all we can do
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 16:52): I'm happy to call him, but really I feel I'm going to have to offer escalation as I have even less to offer than I did the last time we spoke i.e. he was waiting for the call listen results. So if I call now, you'll be available to take the call?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 16:54): to be honest I don't think you will have to offer an escalation I would say he will ask himself
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 16:57): yes. so are you available?or could you call him when you are?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 17:09): I am available but will be taking my lunch soon
 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 18:26): I'm going to try calling the uncharged tv man now [redacted]You're available?

 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (09/10 19:22): I'm available now do you still have him on the line

 * Daniel Jackson (09/10 19:16 Edited): Hi Jessica. I hope you're well. Sorry about this long one! Noel tells me you're potentially available if I need to escalate. I have a callback to do which seems absolutely certain it will require escalation. [redacted] called in very angry on monday. after one year where he wasn't being fully billed for his tv, suddenly on his latest bill, the full tv price was added to his bill, increasing it by £45. Having spoken to DI about it, they confirmed there had been a glitch, but the new monthly charges of 106.99 are now correct. Jason had offered to search for the call when the original order was placed, as cx insists he was promised tv at £6. I was off tues/weds, but jason said he would check the call ready for today. However, Jason is off today and I can't find any evidence he looked for the call. I told Noel who advised we wouldn't have it as it's over a year ago. Noel advised I call cx and raise a dsar if that's what it came to. However, I pointed out I have to get confirmation from customer they understand "Call recordings are kept for 1 year and then are automatically deleted in accordance with our policy." Noel agreed in that case a dsar wasn't suitable to offer. And so, I really have nothing to go back to the customer with, and feel the only thing I can do is offer to escalate. I've been trying to sort this out all day, and missed the callback time of 3pm. I can see from notes the customer has already called in today, chasing the callback. It also doesn't seem to have progressed, and from talking to him on monday, I would be shocked if he's agreed to pay the additional £45. The complaint I opened on Monday remains open.Given that I have nothing further to offer the customer, I have delayed calling back until I can be confident someone will be available to discuss his case when I do call. He was very critical of waiting last time we spoke, and on a very short fuse.

 * Daniel Jackson (12/10 14:48 Edited): [Quoted] DanielMark Jackson (XBC26 C) 09/10/2025 13:09[Quoted] Hey Jason. Did you get an opportunity to look for this call? Jason - believe me, I'd rather not be raising this again. I did raise with noel, who was unable to find call. I don't feel it's appropriate raising a dsar as the statement we're obliged to get agreement to clearly says calls are kept for maximum of 1 year, and call is over a year ago. This left me with nothing to offer cx, other than escalation. Based on that, I tried coordinating with noel so he'd be available to take call when I called cx back,. Based on how angry cx was before, I felt calling him up and then making him wait for ages while I organised someone to take the call was best avoided. Without going into details, I attempted to co-ordinate with another TL before call but without success. I'm under pressure to get my complaints closed today.I'll try calling cx this afternoon, can you be available when I do? Is there anything I could offer to try preventing escalation?

 * Daniel Jackson (06/10 20:21): I probably didn't explain it well enough. He was really making a problem out of nothing, and it was after I'd actually gone out of my way to try and ensure he didn't have a problem further down the line, i.e. making a payment now to then be passed to value and told he couldn't make any changes. Anyway, he's gone now. He says he'll be calling back tomorrow to complain about me, but that's fine, I don't think I should have done anything differently.
 * Jessica ODriscoll (XBC26 C) (06/10 20:22): I see, dont you worry if a complaint is made, you get your chance to say what you did on the call etc and that youd reached out for guidance etc - some CX can be difficult in that way, hope you're ok!

 * Daniel Jackson (20/10 14:24): Sorry I've logged in late today, and that I haven't yet called the customer I said I would contact first thing. This particular case has made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I felt it was appropriate to take some time to review Ofcom's regulations before proceeding. From what I've read, the route I'm expected to take doesn't seem to align fully with General Condition C4 and the Ofcom-approved Complaints Code, which require that providers follow a clear process to investigate complaints, tell the customer the outcome of that investigation, and, if the issue remains unresolved, issue a written response or ADR (Alternative Dispute Resolution) letter. Could you clarify how I should proceed on this call? After I explain to the customer that the sales call can't be found, and that you've told me the httc still apply, what should I then be offering or advising her? I completely understand that you want this complaint closed, but I hope you can appreciate that part of my responsibility as an agent is to be aware of Ofcom's regulations and flag any potential areas of non-compliance. My aim is to act correctly and uphold compliance standards – not to avoid work.
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (20/10 15:51): Can I first ask a reason for being late, the resolution for the complaint would be that the HTTC would stand as no call was found and customer only made contact with us mentioning they did not want the TV after it was cancelled. We don't have to offer anything, not all cases would require something offered, again this is similar to the other call back you had, I cant advise you on what to say until you make the call back as I can not guarantee how the customer is going to react to the situation. The call i had this morning that was over 2 hours long was in relation to complaints as is our training at 4 today. once a complaint has been opened for 54 days automatically a deadlock letter is sent, A deadlock letter costs 265 per letter sent to a customer. the reason why not only myself but the client are asking guides to close complaints within a short window is to avoid cases going to deadlock, Between Jan - Aug this year EE/BT has spent 1.3 million on deadlock letters. Of course there will be cases that will warrant deadlocks being raised but that would have to be escalated properly ( so starting with you, then myself, then ECR and then deadlock). I am in no way asking you to go against compliance standards. What I am asking is that you follow the guidance set by the client you have relayed the information to myself. so I can do the same with the team.

 * Daniel Jackson (17/10 13:10): [redacted] you may remember I spoke to you about him before. the call couldn't be found to listen to, and I have absolutely nothing to offer him when calling. on the day we didn't manage to coordinate before you left, I then sent a message about him to jessica, and she ignored it. last weekend I sent an message to jason, who had originally offered to try and find original call, and he also totally ignored it. both messages were sent with hours left in the shift I think calling him up with no support ready, and then keeping him waiting while I try and arrange a manager, would be worse than not calling him at all.

As I mentioned earlier this week if not last week, all complaint must be closed on the call unless its due to a miss sell.
 * Daniel Jackson (17/10 13:43): this is where I find myself in a difficult position. how can I put it to a customer who needs to wait for an account cease/final bill/and most importantly a credit, that they will be receiving a notification that we consider their issue resolved? and I hate saying this, because it's not that I don't respect you, but looking into regulations on complaint handling, my view seems to be supported.
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (17/10 13:44): [Quoted] DanielMark Jackson (XBC26 C) 17/10/2025 13:10[Quoted] [redacted] you may remember I spoke to you about him before. the call couldn't be found to listen to, and I have absolutely nothi...so we you first said about this call to me it was at 16:07, you would have had roughly the next 4 hours after that point to call the customer back when I was available, you dont know how the call is going to go until you call him back, if it was the customer request the he wants to escalate after that point that if fine but you dont need to have a manager lined up waiting to escalate the call, I have given you every possible option that anyone would be able to do for him regardless of seniority. all thats left to do is call the customer back, the longer that you wait to call him back the more unhappy he is going to be as promises were broken, so he is bound to be angry off the get go before you even mention any call findings or lack there of to him
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (17/10 14:42): [Quoted] DanielMark Jackson (XBC26 C) 17/10/2025 13:43[Quoted] this is where I find myself in a difficult position. how can I put it to a customer who needs to wait for an account cease/final bill/and...just in relation to this, can you share which regulation that you were looking at that wouldnt support the complaint being closed, going from the note thats on the complaint " cease order not successful in past resulting in being overcharged since move to virgin. " the resolution for this would be getting the account closed, no where does it mention about needing to wait for final bill. while it is mentioned in the action on the account it would still need to be mentioned in the complaint itself if you are leaving the complaint open for this reason. the issue they called into you with was that the cease order failed and that they would need to be refunded for charges which we are unable to do so until the final bill comes through, there is notes on the account from a previous agent to say that once the final bill comes through we will refund any HTTC from the account.
 * Daniel Jackson (17/10 15:25 Edited): Thanks for discussing this Noel. I was looking at Ofcom's general condition C4 and the complaints code under it (paragraphs 7 + 14). It says we've got to keep taking steps to resolve a complaint until it's actually resolved or properly closed. In this case the final bill and refund still need to happen, so I'm just not sure how that counts as resolved. I do understand that credits will go on later, but that's kind of the core of what she raised, and she's understandably concerned that promises won't be met. I'm not trying to make things awkward. But I also value part of my role being able to genuinely help customers. That doesn't mean I am predisposed to telling them what they want to hear, but it does mean I want to be confident I'm working within regulations. If there's any internal guidance that says it's ok to close at this stage, can you share it? This would help me understand for next time.

 * Daniel Jackson (18/10 15:29): [redacted] cancelled account today and it's only been active since tuesday. I've been talking to him for a little while and going round in circles a bit, although he is very nice. He has some cognitive difficulties. any chance we can cancel the 32.99 bill which is currently showing? He's panicking about the final bill. cease due to go through on 27th, but he'd stop the service now if he could.
 * Jason Campbell (XBC26 C) (18/10 15:31): [Quoted] DanielMark Jackson... 18/10/2025 15:29[Quoted] [redacted] cancelled account today and it's only been active since...So he would be credited back on the final bill for the services not used - I understand his concern, however, I dont want to double credit him, you know
 * Daniel Jackson (18/10 15:36): yes, fair enough. would you expect the final bill to charge from 14th - 27th when it's produced? Is it fair to advise him that he can dispute this charge and request the bill to be waived in full when it comes? he' would stop now if he could, so barely 4 days service
 * Jason Campbell (XBC26 C) (18/10 15:38): yea - He can dispute the bill is he so wishes, but dont make any promises with it

I've explained that the only two options I can offer are either to allow the dd to take the full amount now, and then wait for a refund on next bill, or cancel the dd now, pay this bill by card (minus the tv) and then reinstate dd when next bill is generated. But he will not accept this and says he's not going anywhere until we change the dd amount for this month

T-26 — ESCALATION PROMISED THEN DENIED, CONFLICTING LEADERSHIP, AGENT UNDERMINED

Chat name: JESSICA O’DRISCOLL DM
Date: SUN 19/10
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 12:35 Edited): Hi Jess, wondering if you can help. I spoke to [redacted] yesterday who was getting in contact as he'd received a bill since cease order had gone through. I explained the process and all seemed well, but it then transpired he expects to be leave without httc. His presentation of it is that there's been a long standing understanding by ee that speeds in his area are so slow, that he had the right to leave if they didn't improve. he says this dates back over two years. The only recent evidence he thinks could be located is a call in July or August with an agent in Northern Ireland. I've had a look at calls around this time though and can't find evidence. Tech have confirmed an engineer visit for slow speeds, but say the speeds, although slow, didn't fall below guarantee. Perhaps this shouldn't be taken into account, but he is a former mp and lawyer, and comes across as such! He's been quite vocal about going to regulators if this causes any problems. I did say I would call him today with an update.
 * Jessica ODriscoll (XBC26 C) (19/10 12:59): hello so i would say that he needs to go through to tech to allow them to investigate any speed or fault issues as it will ultimately be their decision on that basis as to whether he can leave without HTTC
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 13:02): I already spoke to tech and they said they couldn't as the speed wasn't below guarantee
 * Jessica ODriscoll (XBC26 C) (19/10 13:03): ok so he would be liable for the HTTC
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 13:04): so when I call back and he says he'll therefore go to ofcom, I should escalate?
 * Jessica ODriscoll (XBC26 C) (19/10 13:05): yes reach out in the support chat and a TL will take the escalation
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 13:06): ok. thank you

 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 16:32): whats up with escaltion
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 16:34 Edited): these are my notes from yesterday when I spoke to him. I just called back today confirming that httc would apply (decision from Jess): CX called unhappy re: bill issued after cease. Advised final bill still to be produced. Cease had been delayed; checked account to ensure no issues clearing charges once final bill generated. CX claimed he was told no notice period/HTTC due to very slow speeds + no upgrade planned. No evidence found to support this. Connections confirmed slow speeds but no record of waiver. Tech confirmed engineer visit for drops, but no speeds below guarantee. Informed CX no evidence of promise to waive fees; advised possible resolution if call recording located. CX recalled speaking to NI agent late June/early Aug; no matching call found. CX stated arrangement dates back to complaint during recontracting a couple of years ago when told new lines were coming soon and he'd be free to leave if not delivered. CX warned he will escalate to Ofcom/Ombudsman if charges applied. [redacted]
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 16:37): 2 secs let me have a look theres no HTTC on the account ?
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 16:38): final bill hasnt been produced
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 16:38): contract was till april 26 i think
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 16:38): we cant dispute charges that havent been applied [image text unreadable]
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 16:42): with the call charges one we can dispute the charges not on a bill =- you can waive the £26 ones now but cx will have to call to get the other removed when bill is issued - you can leave note to say we can
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 16:39): obviously jess didnt know the HTTC weren't on a bill yet - i would be more than happy to take this call if the HTTC were on a bill but i cant dispute charges that arent on a bill
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 16:48): I don't really understand why you can't take an escalation based on something which we know is going to happen. As far as EE is concerned right now, there is no need to dispute httc, because he is liable for them. The fact is clear - his account is terminated, and he terminated believing that httc would not be applied. [image text unreadable] and if Jess did think httc had already been applied, then she really didn't pay attention to the message I sent her
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 16:55): there is no comms to show cx is getting HTTC so i cant dispute charges that there is no proof of having unless there is a final bill that shows me he is getting them i am after going through all emails and doesnt have any amount of HTTC on them also arte you logged off your phone panel ?
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 16:59): yes I am, because I don't want to get stuck on a call and not be in a position to discuss this with you. I just called him back and promised a manager would contact him today, and with the end of the day rapidly approaching, it feels like that promise could very easily be broken
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 17:02): you are not allowed to log off your phone panel for this reason ? if you reached out i could have told you to jump into a code - for no reason is anyone allowed to just log off unfortunately
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 17:03): may I have a code to use then
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 17:04 Edited): you've had 20 mins offline now so i think take a call and i will look into this
 * Daniel Jackson (time unreadable): I have asked various people for advice regarding this account, and everyone has agreed there aren't any notes supporting leaving without httc. no one has said they don't think they will be applied. However, perhaps they won't. You think they may not be?
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 17:12): I agree i have no idea if they are going to be or not - cant find any evidence to support that they will be nevermind an amount i have looked through all order cease confirmation comms and doesn't mention any HTTC charges that's why I cant even take the call to discuss them. I agree it is a weird one cause doesn't say on email. I have spoke to Jason here with me about it also and he agrees there is nothing we can do unless there is proof of them
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 17:30): what time do you finish?
 * Keelyn Ryan (XBC26 C) (19/10 18:16): soon what time are you finihed
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 18:19): 5:30 officially, but I have a couple of complaints noel wants closed by tomorrow which I'm looking at
 * Daniel Jackson (19/10 18:26): I really don't want to argue Keelyn. But as someone who would like to help customers where possible, this job can feel like a battle. I have gone out of my way for the customer I have brought to you for escalation, and it's disappointing that my promise to him is being broken. You have not only refused to take it, you've also not given any guidance following that decision.

 * Daniel Jackson (31/10 16:47): GB29780292 is an 85 year old lady who recently lost her husband. she went to the brixton store to reduce costs, and decided to remove her landline from account. instead of simply removing the landline, the staff there cancelled her existing contract, and then sold her a more expensive package, with more than she needs/wants. this was hidden by the fact it comes with 3 months free. She has contacted us about this already, very unhappy that her broadband will be 46.99/month, where previously it was 35.99. She has been advised that she must return to store to dispute, which she has done a couple of times, but she says that each time the staff there have been very rude and told her that there isn't a manager available in the store for her to speak to. She says that she will not return to the store because they were so rude. She says she doesn't know what to do next. What should I suggest?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (31/10 16:49): is its a miss sell that happened in the store, only the store would be able to handle it, we wouldn't have any calls to listen to, I understand that she may not want to go back to the store, but they are the only ones who can resolve the issue
 * Daniel Jackson (31/10 16:51): there are two closed complaints on account, one 24 days ago, the other 9 days ago,. both detailing exactly what I said. What should I do with the complaint I raise?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (31/10 16:53): I wouldn't be raising a new one, you can reopen either one of the ones already closed, I would close it being that we cant resolve the issue as customer would need to go back to store
 * Daniel Jackson (31/10 16:55): if it can't be resolved, she should be offered adr, no?
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (31/10 17:00): as I said the only ones who could resolve it are the store, it would be up to the customer if she wants to escalate it after that we can offer an ADR to her

 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (31/10 17:13): if shes not willing to go back to the store there very little we can do, the most we could do is to see if value can offer anything cheaper
 * Daniel Jackson (31/10 17:23): she would like to speak to a manager
 * Noel Curran (XBC26 C) (31/10 17:24): can you reopen one of the complaints
